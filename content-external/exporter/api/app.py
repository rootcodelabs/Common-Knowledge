"""FastAPI surface for the content-external exporter.

Settings are built once in the lifespan and stashed on app.state. Handlers
receive them via Depends; services built by later stages receive them as
constructor arguments. Nothing imports a settings object from
exporter.api.config — there isn't one.

Later stages add POST /export_agency_async and POST /drain_deletions here.
