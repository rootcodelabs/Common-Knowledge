"""Environment-built configuration for the content-external exporter.

Deliberately unlike cleaning/api/config.py in one respect: there is NO
module-level `settings = Settings()` singleton. Settings are built once in the
FastAPI lifespan (exporter/api/app.py) and injected from there — handlers via
Depends, services as a constructor argument. Nothing under exporter/services/
or exporter/core/ may import a settings object. That is the cross-cutting
Config rule: "injected as constructor arguments, never a module-global
singleton reached into from a service."

Scope note (A10, closed by A12). Every variable in the design's env block is
declared here with its documented default. CONTENT_WORK_DIR is the only
unconditionally required one; everything else is required *conditionally*, and
those conditions are the @model_validator methods at the bottom of Settings —
the four-row startup validation matrix from
content-external-pipeline.md#config-and-secrets.

MANIFEST-STORE RESOLUTION IS ALL-OR-NOTHING (A12, D17). The switch is whether
MANIFEST_STORE_BACKEND is set. When it is empty the manifest store IS the
object-store sink's own store — endpoint, bucket AND prefix all inherited —
and MANIFEST_STORE_* is ignored in its entirety, including
MANIFEST_STORE_PREFIX's non-empty default.

That last clause is the non-obvious one, so it is spelled out. The design's env
block documents `MANIFEST_STORE_PREFIX=content-manifests`, which reads like a
default that always applies. If resolution merged field-by-field, an
object-store deployment that set nothing would write its manifest under
`content-manifests/...` instead of under CONTENT_EXTERNAL_PREFIX — and
verification 20 requires that such a deployment write to the pre-change key
*byte-identically*, gaining no configuration at all. So `content-manifests` is
the recommended value for an llm_module deployment (which must set the backend
explicitly anyway), never a default that silently relocates an object-store
deployment's manifest.
