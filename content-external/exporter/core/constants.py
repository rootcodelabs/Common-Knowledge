"""Invariant constants.

Pure: no I/O, no network, no destination — so it belongs under core/
alongside the rest of the unit-tested heart.

These are the values an operator must NOT be able to change at runtime.
They are baked into the code, not read from the environment, because they
feed the chunker fingerprint: if any of them could drift independently of
a deliberate code change, the fingerprint would stop being a reliable
signal that "something about how we process documents changed" and a
corpus could end up with mixed geometry with no record of how that
happened. Bump a value here only when you deliberately want every document
to be treated as changed on the next run.
