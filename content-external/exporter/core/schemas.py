"""Shared data shapes passed between the pure core, the diff, the publish
coordinator and the sinks.

Plain frozen dataclasses, not pydantic: by the time data reaches this layer
it has already been read from CKB or from a committed manifest, so there is
nothing left to validate — pydantic stays at the API boundary
(exporter/api/config.py, exporter/api/models.py) where untrusted input
actually arrives. Frozen so nothing downstream can mutate a shape another
function is still holding a reference to.

Every one of these is serialised with json.dump, never pickled — the
manifest and the run report are meant to be read by a human or another
process, not only by this one. json.dump cannot take a dataclass, so
to_json_dict() turns one into plain dicts and lists first.

frozen=True only stops attribute rebinding; a dict field would still be
mutable in place (`manifest.documents["x"] = ...`). So every mapping field
is frozen on construction into a read-only view, nested values included.

TextSpan and Chunk are the two shapes the design's own documents never spell
out field-by-field (they are named once in a file listing and nowhere
else). Their fields here are built from what the documents DO state
directly elsewhere: chunks are addressed by ordinal and stored as
chunks/{ordinal:05d}.json; chunk_id is a pure function of
(agency_id, document_id, ordinal) and never of the chunk's own text; and
"chunks minus overlap reconstruct the normalised text exactly" requires
each chunk to carry both its text and its position in the source. Flagged
here rather than presented as a quoted spec.
